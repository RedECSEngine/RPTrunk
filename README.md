![RPTrunk - A flexible state machine and toolkit for games](https://github.com/pyrus-io/RPTrunk/blob/master/Logo/logo.png)

## Under development
Nothing is final.

## Dev notes!

### >>>>>>>> Targeting
- "anyAlly" // ally to entity (or array of entities?)
- 'smart' targeting. Possibly game rules for who to target in an array
- Allies / Enemies

### Logic
- metadata parser possibly "target.?hasTheStaff = true" -> target.meta["hasTheStaff"]
 
### Entity
- Meta dictionary






### Back Burner
- Experience and leveling up
- Ability, cache setter for number of repeats
- Position for attack/cast radius
- Abilities w/ area of effect
- Misses, Crits, Dodges, Blocks - Or only some of them? //modifiers on existing structures?
    - Try solving this through other means
    - These could be stats considered during conflict resolution
- Printable entities/contents
