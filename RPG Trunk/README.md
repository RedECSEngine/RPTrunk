- Position
    - attack/cast radius
- Misses, Crits, Dodges, Blocks - Or only some of them? //modifiers on existing structures?

## Ability
- Multistrike /multi-event type abilities

    - getAvailableAbilities() call with any conditions/limitations considered
- Passive abilities with conditions that execute on events
