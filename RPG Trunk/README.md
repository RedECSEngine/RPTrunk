# TODOS!

## AI Logic

#### Conditional parser
- "anyAlly" // ally to entity (or array of entities?)
- metadata parser possibly "target.?hasTheStaff = true" -> target.meta["hasTheStaff"]
 
## Entity
- Meta dictionary
- Buffs/Debuffs
  - decay on tick
  - decay on event (being attacked)
- MP costs for abilities
    - getAvailableAbilities() call with any conditions/limitations considered
- Experience and leveling up
- Position
    - attack/cast radius

## Stats
- Magics
  - affinities/resistances
 
## Other todos
- Multistrike /multi-event type abilities
  - e.g. Punch, punch, kick
- Printable entities/contents
- Misses, Crits, Dodges, Blocks - Or only some of them? //modifiers on existing structures?
- Abilities w/ area of effects
- Preloading from and access from dictionaries
